On September 16th we got a <a target="_blank" href="/content/Events.aspx">session</a> on Security Auditing & ACS Optimization by [Jeremiah Beckett](http://securevantage.spaces.live.com/blog) from [Securevantage](http://www.securevantage.com/).

&nbsp;

Jeremiah has [](/media/p/646.aspx)recorded the session for us so that you can watch it. It&rsquo;s condensed into about 1/3 original time, 30min, but covers all content and includes demo. Jeremiah added also theire [ACS Resource Kit](/media/p/647.aspx) .
