Microsoft released beginning of March the updated Cloud Service Process pack that is now fully compatible with System Center 2012 SP1. You can download the new process pack here: [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36497](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36497 "http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36497")&#160;&#160; CSPP is an extension pack built on top of System Center. This release is compatible only with System Center 2012 and 2012 SP1. This release does not contain a new feature set from prior releases.

When I tried to install CSPP I got the following error:

I opened the log files of the CSSP setup that are located at the following location:

When I search through the log file I discovered the following error:

[<img title="clip_image003" style="border-left-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="clip_image003" src="http://www.mscloud.be/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/clip_image003_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="43" />](http://www.mscloud.be/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/clip_image003.jpg)

03:12:25:Checking if current user is valid Orchestrator user or not  
03:12:27:System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x800708AC): The group name could not be found.

My account is a local admin and I could perfectly connect to Orchestator and create and launch runbooks so I was quite suprised to see this error.

So I looked locally in computer managed and you need two groups: the first one is the OrchestratorSystemGroup and the second one is the OrchestratorUserGroup which apparently didn’t exist on my orchestrator server! This means the Orchestator pre-requisites checker is checking for a group which doesn’t exist locally!

So I created manually a new group and added my account to the group

[<img title="clip_image007" style="border-left-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="clip_image007" src="http://www.mscloud.be/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/clip_image007_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="240" />](http://www.mscloud.be/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/clip_image007.jpg)

[<img title="clip_image009" style="border-left-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="clip_image009" src="http://www.mscloud.be/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/clip_image009_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="77" />](http://www.mscloud.be/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/clip_image009.jpg)

After that I closed and re-opened the setup wizard and everything went through without any issues!

Hope this helps,

Alex
