Guys,

&nbsp;

You definitely have to check this out!!

**<span style="text-decoration: underline"></span>**

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">PRESS RELEASE</span>**

We are proud to announce **<a target="_blank" href="http://SystemCenterCentral.com">SystemCenterCentral.com</a>**, the site to visit for &ldquo;Everything System Center&rdquo;.

SystemCenterCentral.com was founded by three System Center community members; Pete Zerger, Rory McCaw and Maarten Goet. SystemCenterCentral.com is a community initiative that will combine a number of existing Internet properties under a single community site and strive to become the leading community landing page for all System Center technologies.

As Microsoft continues to invest in its System Center brand, we feel that there is a need for a community site that focuses exclusively on the technologies included in this suite of products. Unlike other community sites, the motivation behind this site is to continue to give back to the community at large, one of the reasons why each of the founders have been awarded the Microsoft MVP title.

The official launch of SystemCenterCentral.com will be at the **Microsoft Management Summit (MMS)** in Las Vegas, NV, the week of April 27 to May 2, 2009. SystemCenterCentral.com has a **dedicated community area** where you can check out the site, get more information or become a member!

At this time you will find **blogs**, _where well-known MVPs will start blogging in the coming days_, a **download area**, a **community &ldquo;pack catalog&rdquo;** and **forums**. Later in May, we will be launching a **wiki** and a **&lsquo;community feedback&rsquo;** platform and other exciting features.

SystemCenterCentral.com is a strong supporter of **user groups**. We have the commitment of the following user groups to user SystemCenterCentral.com as the main landing page to find their user group and some of these groups will transfer their internet presence to SystemCenterCentral.com in the following weeks:

_Atlanta Systems Management User Group, Microsoft Enterprise Management User Group (Denver), System Center Professional&rsquo;s User Group of Jax (Florida), New York System Center User Group, Portland EPG System Center User Group, Northwest System Center User Group (Seattle), Windows Management User Group (UK), System Center User Group (Netherlands), System Center User Group (Belgium), System Center User Group (Malaysia), System Center Virtual User Group and the Powershell Virtual User Group._

We would like to thank our sponsors for making this possible. Both **Quest Software** and **Microsoft** are supporting SystemCenterCentral.com as **Gold Sponsors** and will be active participant in this new online community. By having them as gold sponsors, we are confident this will become the go-to, online community for all things System Center..

Also, we would like to thank **Bridgeways** and **SecureVantage**, who are supporting SystemCenterCentral.com as **Silver Sponsors**.

Not going to MMS, but still want to check out this new System Center community site? **Go to** [**www.systemcentercentral.com**](http://www.systemcentercentral.com) now and join!

**Best regards,** 

Peter Zerger, Rory McCaw and Maarten Goet
