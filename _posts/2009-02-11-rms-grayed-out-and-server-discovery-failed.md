After I installed my RMS and OpsmgrDB on two different servers my root management server went gray and every 10 minutes or so I receive an alert stating the RMS is unavailable.&nbsp; Usually these close within a minute but some times take up to 10 minutes.&nbsp; 

Below is the alert I receive.

Alert: Root Management Server Unavailable.

Alert description: The root management server (Healthservice) has stopped  
heartbeating soon after Fri, 01 Feb 2008 23:17:29 GMT. This adversely affects  
all availability calculation for the entire management group.

Also got the following error when I wanted to discover and install agents on my server:

&#8220;An exception was thrown while processing LaunchDiscovery for session id uuid:57e9b453-4e4f-465c-9c48-c8d7d209e747;id=5.&nbsp; Exception Message: The creator of this fault did not specify a Reason.  
Full Exception: System.ServiceModel.FaultException\`1&#8243;

&nbsp;

I checked the time on my RMS Server and on the SQL server and there was a 3 minute delay!

&nbsp;

The resolution was to resync the time on both servers with the following command

NET TIME %LOGONSERVER% /SET /Y

&nbsp;

After the resync everything went fine!! My rms went green and I could discover and install my agents again!!
