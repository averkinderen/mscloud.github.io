If you are looking at Microsoft Infrastructure as a service from a Service provider perspective or Enterprise the following is a must read!

[https://curah.microsoft.com/257301/what-are-the-technological-underpinnings-of-a-microsoft-infrastructure-as-a-service-infrastructure](https://curah.microsoft.com/257301/what-are-the-technological-underpinnings-of-a-microsoft-infrastructure-as-a-service-infrastructure "https://curah.microsoft.com/257301/what-are-the-technological-underpinnings-of-a-microsoft-infrastructure-as-a-service-infrastructure")

Tom Shinder is describing in depth all the different technology underpinnings. You will find different articles that provides you with handy links to content that will help you understand Microsoft Infrastructure as a Service &#8211; on-premises, public cloud (Azure) and hybrid cloud. Also included are some architectural design patterns to help you think about how you might design your own IaaS infrastructure.

Thanks,

Alex
