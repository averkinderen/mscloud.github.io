Today, January 1st like every year is a very big day for all January MVP’s as we get to know if we are renewed for another year or not!

And around 4pm I received the long waited email from Microsoft!

Congrats to all new and renewed MVP’s! Hope to see you soon at one or the other community event!

See you soon,

Alexandre
