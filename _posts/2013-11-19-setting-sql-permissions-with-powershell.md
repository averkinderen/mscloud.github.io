In the next couple of posts I’m going to blog about automating a System Center post-configuration deployment with Powershell. After you have deployed a typical SC environment you still need to do quite a lot of configuration. The following posts will cover how to automate this with Powershell.

&nbsp;

The first powershell script is to define a specific user account as a sysadmin on a bunch of SQL servers:

[powershell]

<sub>#Variables  
$Servers = @("srv01.contoso.com",”srv02.contoso.com”)</sub>

<sub>  
#Connect remotely to the server</sub>

<sub>  
Foreach($Server in $Servers)  
{ </sub>

<sub>Invoke-Command -ComputerName $Server -ScriptBlock { </sub>

<sub>  
#Set the system account as sysadmin</sub>

<sub>[System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName(&#8216;Microsoft.SqlServer.SMO&#8217;) | out-null </sub>

<sub># Create SMO Connections to both SQL Instances  
$Svr = New-Object (&#8216;Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server&#8217;) "$server"  
$svrole = $svr.Roles | where {$_.Name -eq &#8216;sysadmin&#8217;}  
$svrole.AddMember("User account”)  
}  
}</sub>

[/powershell]

Thanks,
