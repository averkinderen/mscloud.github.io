Wished you could receive training from someone that co-authored a book on the topic he is teaching? Are you looking for real 400 level training? Want training from a consultant with plenty of real-life experience? Ever wished you could receive training from the folks that gave those sessions at Teched (Us or Europe), MMS, Techdays ?
