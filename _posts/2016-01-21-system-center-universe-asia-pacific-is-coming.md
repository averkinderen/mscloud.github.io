The biggest Cloud and Datacenter event in Asia is back!

<a href="http://mscloudstorage.blob.core.windows.net/mscloudstorage/2016/01/SCUAPac.png" rel="attachment wp-att-9791"><img class="size-full wp-image-9791 alignright" src="http://mscloudstorage.blob.core.windows.net/mscloudstorage/2016/01/SCUAPac.png" alt="SCUAPac" width="252" height="252" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SCUAPac.png 252w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SCUAPac-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SCUAPac-55x55.png 55w" sizes="(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px" /></a>

The event will be a 2-day event in KL, Malaysia on Tuesday and Wednesday 8th-9th March at Sheraton Imperial Kuala followed by a 1-day event in Melbourne hosted on Friday 11th March at Crown Casino.

I will speak about OMS together with my friend and MVP Tao (<a href="http://blog.tyang.org/" target="_blank">http://blog.tyang.org/</a> ).
