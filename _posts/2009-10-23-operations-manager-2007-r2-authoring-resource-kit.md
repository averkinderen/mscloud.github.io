o&#160; MP Diff shows the differences between two management packs.

o&#160; MP Cookdown Analyzer identifies workflows which may break cookdown.&#160; Suggestions are provided for how to fix the performance problems.

o&#160; All References Add-in helps find all management pack elements that reference the specific element chosen. For example, the ability to right click a class and find all rules, monitors, overrides, as well as anything else that targets that class is provided. This tool works on most management pack elements.

Key functionality includes the ability to test workflows as well as view and validate output prior to signing and importing the MP into a Management Group for additional testing.

· Management Packs

o&#160; Three management packs which are frequently used as dependencies are provided as part of the tools installation.&#160; These MPs are necessary to allow the Authoring Console to open most MPs available online in the System Center Operations Manager MP Catalog. The provided MPs are:
