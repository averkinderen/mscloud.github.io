Hello OM Community,

Today we launched a new connect portal that will allow YOU to provide feedback to the OM team as well as participate in surveys that have been traditionally reserved for our TAP programs.  
All you need to do is be registered on connect and you&#8217;ll be able to participate.  
Check it out here, <https://connect.microsoft.com/opsmgr>

&#160;

You can for example fill in the survey for the new SQL mp and give valuable feedback to the opsmgr product team.

&#160;

Greetz,

Alexandre Verkinderne
