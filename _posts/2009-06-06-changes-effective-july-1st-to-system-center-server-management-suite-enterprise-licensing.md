Components of Server Management Suite Enterprise 

Enterprise server management licences<Server MLs> for 

  * · System Center Operations Manager 2007, 
  * · System Center Configuration Manager 2007 R2, 
  * · System Center Data Protection Manager 2007 
  * · System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008 
  * · And System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008 Management Server License

****

**Current licensing Rules:** Rights to manage an unlimited number of operating system environments (OSEs) on a single physical server 

**<u>Upcoming System Center Server Management Suite Enterprise Licensing Changes</u>**

Two System Center Server Management Suite licensing changes will become effective 1 July, 2009, with the release of Microsoft System Center Operations Manager 2007 R2*: 

  * · System Center Server Management Suite Enterprise <SMSE>will be switched from an unlimited operating system environment to a four operating system environment, limited licence with a corresponding 20 per cent price decrease. 
  * · A new suite offering, **Microsoft System Center Server Management Suite Datacenter** <SMSD> will be introduced and will include the same products as System Center Server Management Suite Enterprise, but, it will be licensed per processor and will provide for the management of an unlimited number of operating system environments. 

*Licensing changes become effective when customers adopt System Center Operations Manager 2007 R2 and subsequent releases of the other products included in the System Center Server Management Suite family.

&#160;

I hope this will only affect new licenses bought after July 1 and that existing customers can still upgrade to Opsmgr R2 with an unlimited management of VM’s.
