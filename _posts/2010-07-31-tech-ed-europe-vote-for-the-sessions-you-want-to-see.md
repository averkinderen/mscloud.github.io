You have the ability to influence what sessions will be shown at Tech Ed Europe.

Go to <http://europe.msteched.com/sessionpreference>. There you can see a list of sessions that have been shortlisted for possible inclusion into Tech Ed Europe.

One of my sessions has made the short-list.&#160; Enter “Opalis” into the Keyword search box, and you’ll pull up the session “Opalis & System Center better together” or “System Center… Leveraging the suite”.&#160; Check it out and see what you think.&#160; If you think it would make a nice addition to Tech Ed Europe, please vote for it.&#160; And make sure you check out some of the other great sessions that could potentially be available as well.

&#160;

Thanks,
