Today the System Center Team announced the new capabilities and price changes of the Server Management Suite Enterprise (SMSE) and Server Management Suite Datacenter (SMSD) licenses. You can read the whole <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/systemcenter/archive/2010/01/08/server-management-suites-new-capabilities-and-price-change.aspx" target="_blank">article here</a>.

&#160;

Now with the SMSE and SMSD you will also get:

  * System Center Service Manager Server ML as part of their active Software Assurance coverage when Service Manager will be generally available
  * Opalis software will be granted to any new or existing SMSE or SMSD license with active Software Assurance coverage as of December 10, 2009

&#160;

This has of course a downside on the price. **The SMSE will move from $1,198\* per license to $1,569\* per license and the SMSD will move from $749\* for each per processor license to $1,310\* for each per processor license, effective July 1, 2010.**

&#160;

Thanks,

Alexandre Verkinderen
