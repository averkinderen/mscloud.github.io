Microsoft is going to invest heavily in Dynamic IT / cloud capabilities that Virtual Machine Manager vNext and Operations Manager vNext will deliver.

Here is a small list of things that Microsoft wants to achieve:

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">System Center Virtual Machine Manager </span>**

&middot; Service lifecycle management, including creation, deployment and updates to cloud apps/services &#8211; Leverages [app virtualization](http://www.microsoft.com/systemcenter/appv/dynamic.mspx) technology and service modeling to perform image-based service composition, deployment and updates.

&middot; Creation of [private clouds](http://www.microsoft.com/virtualization/en/us/cloud-computing.aspx) &#8211; Enables &ldquo;Infrastructure as a Service&rdquo; for the enterprise datacenter and allows self-service scenarios; discovery and assignment of logical/virtualized network and storage pools to apps/services.

&middot; Federation across clouds &#8211; Enables workload mobility between on-premises, service provider and public clouds (e.g. Windows Azure) in a secure manner .

&middot; Policy-based dynamic resource optimization &ndash; Ensure optimal utilization of your datacenter resources (e.g. policy driven power management), deeper Operations Manager/PRO integration.

&middot; Deeper [Opalis](http://www.opalis.com/) Integration &ndash; Offers deeper integration with Opalis for enhanced orchestration and automation across multiple sub-systems.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline"></span>**

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">System Center Operations Manager </span>**

&middot; Unified on-premises and cloud monitoring &#8211; Enables hybrid cloud deployment scenarios with &ldquo;single pane of glass&rdquo; monitoring.

&middot; Outside-in/end user experience monitoring for geo distributed cloud services (based on synthetic transactions).

&middot; Service oriented network and storage monitoring (e.g. monitor and troubleshoot network and storage resource pools assigned to services).

You can find more information on the [http://blogs.technet.com/ddcalliance](http://blogs.technet.com/ddcalliance "http://blogs.technet.com/ddcalliance") blog.

Watch this video by Anant Sundaram, Senior Product Manager for System Center.

Anant explaines what Microsoft is thinking around improving data center management and managing cloud environments.

[http://edge.technet.com/Media/Microsoft-on-Whats-Next-for-Managing-Datacenters-and-the-Cloud/](http://edge.technet.com/Media/Microsoft-on-Whats-Next-for-Managing-Datacenters-and-the-Cloud/ "http://edge.technet.com/Media/Microsoft-on-Whats-Next-for-Managing-Datacenters-and-the-Cloud/")

Not all of these will be realized and it will take some product cycles but it gives you a nice overview of what Microsoft is thinking and want to achieve.

Thanks,
