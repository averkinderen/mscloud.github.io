Community Day is back with the **Fourth Edition** of this annual community event on Microsoft technologies!

**Fourteen** Microsoft User Groups combine their efforts to organize this unique networking and knowledge sharing  
event. With so many new releases from Microsoft, the theme of Community Day 2010 is of course 2010: a new wave of products and technologies. This means that most sessions will be looking at Visual Studio 2010, Silverlight 4, Office 2010, SharePoint 2010, SQL Server 2008 R2, OCSR2…
