Hi all,

I am very proud to be able to announce that we will be able to host a Unique Opsmgr 2007 training event in Belgium.

Is the average training not meeting the depth of technical content you need? Would you like the receive your training from someone that received the prestigious MVP Award? Wished you could receive training from someone that co-authored a book on the topic he is teaching? Are you looking for real 400 level training? Want training from a consultant with plenty of real-life experience? Ever wished you could receive training from the folks that gave those sessions at Teched (Us or Europe)? Here is your chance!

**What is being delivered?**

The&nbsp; Management pack development course organized by [Infront Consulting](http://infrontconsulting.com) & RealDolmen

**Description**

This class is designed to provide attendees with the knowledge they require to create a custom Management Pack. The hands-on labs in this class will walk the attendees through the process of creating a custom Management Pack from the design and planning stages through to the creation of reports. This class will use a &lsquo;popular&rsquo; application and step through the MP development process as an exercise that results in a production quality MP that can be used in a production environment. This class will use the Exchange Server 2007 MP developed by Microsoft as an example.
