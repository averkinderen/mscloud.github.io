My BOF session has been selected for TechEd. Now it’s tome to vote!

&#160;

**ABSTRACT:**

Come and join us during this BoF on System Center. Time to sit down with fellow System Center users, share your experiences and issues with System Center in the real world and got them solved!  
If you have some System center related questions but never dared to ask or found no one to answer them this is a BoF you wouldn’t want to miss! Come join Simon Skinner, Maarten Goet and Alexandre Verkinderen to discuss lessons learned around System Center in general in an Open Forum discussion.
