The following additional role services are used in conjunction with Windows Server 2008:

  * TS Web Access: With Terminal Services Web Access (TS Web Access), users can access RemoteApp programs and a Remote Desktop connection to the terminal server through a Web site. TS Web Access also includes Remote Desktop Web Connection, with which users can remotely connect to any computer where they have Remote Desktop access. 
  * TS Gateway: With Terminal Services Gateway (TS Gateway), authorized remote users can connect to resources on an internal corporate network from any Internet-connected device that can run the Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) client. 
  * TS Session Broker: Terminal Services Session Broker (TS Session Broker) supports session load balancing between terminal servers in a farm and reconnection to an existing session in a load-balanced terminal server farm. 

Note: 

  * In Windows Server 2008, the name of the Terminal Services Session Directory feature was changed to Terminal Services Session Broker (TS Session Broker). 
  * When there is problem with the availability or performance of one of these components, Microsoft System Center Operations Manager 2007 uses the Terminal Services Management Pack to detect the issue and alert you so that you can diagnose the problem and fix it.

<span>The Windows Server 2008 Application Server Management Pack includes monitors, rules, views, tasks, knowledge, and reports for the monitoring of Application Server included in the Windows Server 2008 operating system. It provides a knowledge base of useful information to help administrators resolve an issue when the Application Server role becomes unhealthy.</p>

  With this management pack, Information Technology (IT) administrators can collect the events that the components of the Application Server role place in the Windows Server 2008 event logs.

  <span>The Key Management Service is used to activate computers running Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Each activation request is logged on the KMS host. The KMS Management Pack collects data from the event logs of defined KMS hosts, and monitors those hosts for availability. This monitoring provides visibility into the activation traffic and the license status of volume activation clients on the network.</span>
