The following additional role services are used in conjunction with Windows Server 2008:

  * TS Web Access: With Terminal Services Web Access (TS Web Access), users can access RemoteApp programs and a Remote Desktop connection to the terminal server through a Web site. TS Web Access also includes Remote Desktop Web Connection, with which users can remotely connect to any computer where they have Remote Desktop access. 
  * TS Gateway: With Terminal Services Gateway (TS Gateway), authorized remote users can connect to resources on an internal corporate network from any Internet-connected device that can run the Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) client. 
  * TS Session Broker: Terminal Services Session Broker (TS Session Broker) supports session load balancing between terminal servers in a farm and reconnection to an existing session in a load-balanced terminal server farm. 

Note: 

  * In Windows Server 2008, the name of the Terminal Services Session Directory feature was changed to Terminal Services Session Broker (TS Session Broker). 
  * When there is problem with the availability or performance of one of these components, Microsoft System Center Operations Manager 2007 uses the Terminal Services Management Pack to detect the issue and alert you so that you can diagnose the problem and fix it.
