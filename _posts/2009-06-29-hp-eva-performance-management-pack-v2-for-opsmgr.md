In a previous <a href="http://scug.be/blogs/scom/archive/2009/06/17/hp-eva-management-pack.aspx" target="_blank">blogpost</a> I already mentioned that Alain Cote has developped a HP EVA performance management pack. 

&#160;

Alain has continued to improve his management pack and wow we have an update with:

  * better discovery
  * a controller processor monitor 
  * and a report

&#160;

You can get the <a href="http://scug.be/media/p/1112.aspx" target="_blank">HP EVA performance management pack V2 here</a>.

&#160;

Thanks Alain for sharing this with the community!

&#160;

Have fun,
