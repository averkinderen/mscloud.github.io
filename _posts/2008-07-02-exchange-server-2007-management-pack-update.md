A while ago I posted about the <a href="http://scug.be/blogs/scom/archive/2008/06/15/management-packs-roadmap.aspx" target="_blank">management pack Roadmap</a> and the fact that we where stille waiting for an update of the Exchange 2007 Mp.

###### Overview

<a class="" title="Description" name="Description"></a>The Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 management pack is designed to be used for monitoring Exchange 2007 events, collecting Exchange component-specific performance counters in one central location, and for raising alerts for operator intervention as necessary. By detecting, sending alerts, and automatically responding to critical events, this management pack helps indicate, correct, and prevent possible service outages or configuration problems, allowing you to proactively manage Exchange servers and identify issues before they become critical. The management pack monitors and provides alerts for automatic notification of events indicating service outages, performance degradation, health monitoring, and centralized management.  
This Management Pack requires Operations Manager 2007 Service Pack 1.  
This Management Pack requires the Operations Manager 2007 updates specified in Knowledge Base articles 950853, 951979 and 951380 (see the Management Pack Guide for details).
