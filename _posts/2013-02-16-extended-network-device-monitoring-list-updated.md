Microsoft just released and [updated list of devices that can be monitored by Operations Manager 2012](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26831). OpsMgrr 2012 can monitor network devices that support SNMP, and can provide port monitoring for devices that implement interface MIB (RFC 2863) and MIB-II (RFC 1213) standards. You can find more info about those RFC here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management\_information\_base](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_information_base "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_information_base") .
