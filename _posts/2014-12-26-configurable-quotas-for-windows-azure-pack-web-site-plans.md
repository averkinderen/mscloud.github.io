After setting up Windows Azure Pack Web Sites, you can create sets of offerings (or “plans”) for the tenant customers who will use your web site hosting service.

You can create as many plans as you want and name them as you wish. Each plan that you create will have three levels of service: Intro (Shared), Basic (Shared), and Reserved. For each of the three levels, you can configure 17 different quotas related to web site features and capacities.

The combination of quotas that you set for each level of service determines the restrictions and benefits that each level of service in the plan will have.

Click the name of a quota to select it, and then choose Edit in the command bar at the bottom of the page to edit it. In the Quota dialog, specify the values that you want to enforce for each service level. Notice that:

  * Some quotas have an Enforcement Duration (Minutes) setting.
  * Some quotas have an Exceed Action  setting, for which the options are Do nothing, Stop web site, or Redirect to parking page.

So you can create very customized qouta&#8217;s and plans for the websites with some automatic enforcment like automaticily stopping the website or redirecting it to a parking page.
