Hi,

&#160;

Novell just announced two new additions to the Novell Linux Management Pack or NLMP family: 

SLES 11 and RHEL 5.x. 

The Novell Linux Management Packs for OpsMgr expands the monitoring capabilities of Operations Manager by enabling monitoring of key Linux services that are not monitored now with the Cross platform management packs. 

&#160;

You can download the NLMP for OpsMgr from here:
