MMS 2010 will be in Las Vegas April 19-23, and registration is now open. The list of planned sessions is available at <http://www.mms-2010.com/public/sessions.aspx>. There are 28 breakout sessions specific to OpsMgr 2007, and there are some very good ones you won&rsquo;t want to miss. MVPs that will be presenting OpsMgr-related topics include John Joyner, Maarten Goet, Pete Zerger, Rory McCaw, and David Allen.

Many product managers will also be presenting on OpsMgr 2007 R2 topics. In addition, Brian Wren of Microsoft will be again presenting his sessions on Management Pack Authoring. These went over very well last year.

MMS generally has all the System Center breakout sessions you will find at Tech-Ed, and then some. There are also numerous labs with the opportunity to get hands-on training. In addition, it&rsquo;s a great opportunity to network with other systems and operations management ITPros, MVPs, and Microsoft PMs. You&rsquo;ll also find a number of the authors and contributors that worked on _System Center Operations Manager R2 2007 Unleashed_!

There is a discount for registering prior to March 24 &ndash; registration is currently $1,725 and goes up to $1,970 after March 24. For full information, go to <http://www.mms-2010.com>. Hope to see you there!
