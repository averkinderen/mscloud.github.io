A friend of me asked me a couple of days ago how he had to view and configure the datawarehouse data retention policies in Opsmgr. I know it for <a href="http://ops-mgr.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!3D3B8489FCAA9B51!147.entry" target="_blank">MOM 2005</a> but for opsmgr I had to look on the Internet.

Now Daniel Savage has written on the Operations Manager Product Team Blog a post on <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/momteam/archive/2008/05/14/data-warehouse-data-retention-policy-dwdatarp-exe.aspx" target="_blank">how to view and configure the datawarehouse</a> data retention policies in Opsmgr.
