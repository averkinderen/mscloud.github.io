<p>
  <span lang="EN-GB">Intel® Active Management Technology<br /> (Intel® AMT) Management Pack for Microsoft System Center Operations Manager and<br /> System Center Essentials is now available. This management pack enables the<br /> users of these applications to take advantage of the advanced, hardware-based<br /> system management capabilities of Intel® AMT, which are built into PCs with Intel®<br /> VPro™ processor technology. These capabilities will help reduce the cost of<br /> discovering, managing and securing desktop and mobile PCs in the enterprise and<br /> thereby improving compliance with corporate policies. Information Technology<br /> (IT) support staff can now rapidly and remotely communicate with, power up,<br /> reboot, control, inventory assets, and remediate desktop PCs with Intel® VPro™<br /> processor technology even if the PC is powered off or the operating system is<br /> not functioning. Support staff are able to manage PCs more effectively from the<br /> IT support center which leads to a reduction in desk-side visits and hence the<br /> total cost of ownership of computing systems equipped with Intel® VPro™<br /> processor technology. </span><span lang="NL"></span>
