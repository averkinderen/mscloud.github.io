I&#8217;ve written a little [manual](http://scug.be/files/folders/scom/entry144.aspx){.} for configuring your opsmgr or Essentials so you can collect and generate alerts based on syslogs.

&nbsp;

In my example I used a fortigate firewall but you could use whatever network device or unix machine that can send syslogs.

&nbsp;

Have fun,

Alkin
