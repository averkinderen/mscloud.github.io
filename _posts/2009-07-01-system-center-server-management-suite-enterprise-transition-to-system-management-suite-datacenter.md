As mentioned in <a href="http://scug.be/blogs/scom/archive/2009/06/06/changes-effective-july-1st-to-system-center-server-management-suite-enterprise-licensing.aspx" target="_blank">here</a> the&#160; System Center Server Management Suite Enterprise Licensing has changed since today. Microsoft has developed a transition path from the SCSMSE to the newly SMSD:

<u>License Grant:</u>

One-time License Grant of System Center Server Management Suite Datacenter (SMSD) to License Holders of System Center Server Management Suite Enterprise (SMSE): 

As a one-time exception in connection with the transition of SMSE* from a suite that allows for the management of any number of OSEs on a licensed device to a suite that allows for the management of up to four OSEs on a licensed device, we are granting **Select, Enterprise, Open License, Open Value, and Campus and School** customers with **active Software Assurance on SMSE as of July 1, 2009** the following: 

  * <u>Four complimentary SMSD licenses for each qualifying SMSE license</u> with active Software Assurance the customer has as of July 1, 2009. 
  * Each set of four granted SMSD licenses must be assigned to a single device, and may not be separated for use on two or more devices. 
  * The management rights associated with the complimentary SMSD licenses are granted in place of the management rights associated with the qualifying SMSE license. Upon the assignment of the granted SMSD licenses, the customer forfeits its management rights under the corresponding SMSE license.
