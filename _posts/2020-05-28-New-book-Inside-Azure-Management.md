Super proud to announce that our new book ***Inside Azure Management V4*** has been released! This book is the 4th edition and covers a broad range of Azure Management related topics like cloud governance, process automation, infrastructure updates, application, and container monitoring. Writing an ebook was something new to me and definitely a refreshing experience compared to paperback [System Center Unleashed](https://www.amazon.com/System-Center-Service-Manager-Unleashed-ebook/dp/B005G2FSRM/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=alexandre+verkinderen&qid=1590273037&s=digital-text&sr=1-2) series.

Many thanks to [Pete Zerger](https://twitter.com/pzerger) for all the work and coordination he put into this book. And of course a big thank you to the other authors as well:
