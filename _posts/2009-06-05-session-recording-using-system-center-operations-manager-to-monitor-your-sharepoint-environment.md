<span><strong>SESSION RECORDING Using System Center Operations Manager to monitor your SharePoint environment</strong> </span>

<span>System Center Operations Manager 2007 is THE end to </span>end Monitoring Solution. In this session we will discuss what you, as SharePoint guys, find relevant to be monitored.  
System Center Operations Manager uses a SharePoint Monitoring toolkit for monitoring the SharePoint Environment. This toolkit consists of a set of System Center Operations Manager 2007 management packs designed to help IT pros monitor their WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007 and 2007 SP1 environments. These newly released packs were engineered to take advantage of SCOM 2007&rsquo;s features, including new and improved reporting, additional actions, new views, and integrate IIS and SQL health rollup for a better understanding of the system-level dependencies of the SharePoint environments.  
And last but not least: System Center Operations Manager can also emulate end user experience by monitoring a Web Application. We will show you how to monitor a Web Application, even if it is require credentials, and how to record a browser session.
