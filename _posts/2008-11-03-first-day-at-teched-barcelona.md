I&#8217;m now at teched Barcelona and my first impressions? WOOOOW! Everything is very well organized, free wifi, everything is taken care off you even get free metro tickets! I arrived Sunday morning&nbsp; and took the opportunity to visit Barcelona and of course, my first dinner was paella! ðŸ™‚ After that I went to the forum to collect my badge and went to the &#8220;ask the experts&#8221; (ATE) briefing. I&#8217;m standing at the system center/SCE ATE stand. So if you&#8217;re in Barcelona come and join me!

&nbsp;

The next couple of days I&#8217;m going to try to blog some interesting things/announcements. 

&nbsp;

**Announcements of today:**

  * Operations manager 2007 R2 beta end November 
      * Windows 2008 R2 will be launched together with Windows 7</ul>
