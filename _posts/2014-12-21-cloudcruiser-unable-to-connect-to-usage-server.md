Hi,

Last week when installing [Cloudcruiser](http://www.cloudcruiser.com/) for my lab environment I encountered an issue when trying to connect to my WAP usage server. After a few days of searching I gave up and emailed CloudCruiser support and this was their response:

> Make sure you are using Java 7 as per the installation instructions. CCX does not support Java 8 yet and others attempting to install without Java 7 have reported being stuck at this point.

I uninstalled Java 8, installed java version 7 and voila! It worked! I could finally start showcasing the power of Financial management for Clouds:

If you need more information on how to install Cloudcruiser from the beginning read Christopherâ€™s blog post <http://scug.be/christopher/2014/02/28/windows-azure-pack-cloud-cruiser-installation/>

Thanks,
