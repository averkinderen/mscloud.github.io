Hi everyone,

January first is a special day for everyone as it&#8217;s the first day of a new year (so happy new year everyone!) but it&#8217;s also my MVP award renewal day. As an MVP award is only valid for 1 year, every year Microsoft is evaluating your community contribution and decides if you get re-awarded or not.

So on the first day of the year I&#8217;m pressing the refresh button every 5 minutes to wait for the following email:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16961" src="http://www.mscloud.be/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mvp.png" alt="mvp" width="977" height="461" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mvp.png 977w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mvp-300x142.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mvp-768x362.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px" /> 

This will be my 9th consecutive MVP award I receive! I&#8217;m proud of this achievement but this would definitely not be possible without the support of my friends and family.

Thank you all for your support!

Alex
