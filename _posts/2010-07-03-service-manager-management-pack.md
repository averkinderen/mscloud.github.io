Microsoft released the Service Manager 2010 Management Pack. The Microsoft System Center Service Manager 2010 Management Pack helps you manage your Service Manager infrastructure by monitoring the health of the Service Manager management servers and services.

&nbsp;

**Features**:

  * Capturing critical events from Service Manager and creating corresponding alerts in System Center Operations Manager 2007 R2.
  * Monitoring the health of vital Service Manager services and providing users with a real-time health status.
  * Providing Operations Manager integrated knowledge for events.
  * Ensuring that the management pack provides clear health information, and that it is extendible, allowing users to add objects such as monitors, overrides, tasks, and knowledge.

Service Manager Management Pack 7.0.5826.856 supports all configurations that are supported by Microsoft System Center Service Manager 2010.
