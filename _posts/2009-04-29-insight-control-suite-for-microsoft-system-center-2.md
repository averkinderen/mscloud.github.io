#### Insight Control suite for Microsoft System Center  
![](http://www.techlog.org/images/system_center_new.jpg) Insight Control suite for Microsoft System Center (ICE-SC) is the first extensive solution that provides seamless integration of the unique ProLiant and BladeSystem manageability features into the Microsoft System Center consoles. Backed by HP service and support, ICE-SC delivers the best hardware management experience for customers who have standardized on a Microsoft System Center management platform.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

ICE for System Center allows you to:

  * **Quickly and reliably configure, deploy and update** ProLiant servers through Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager. 
  * **Proactively monitor the health** of physical and virtual servers and intelligently respond to hardware events using System Center Operations Manager and System Center Virtual Machine Manager. 
  * **[Remotely control HP servers in any location](http://h18013.www1.hp.com/products/servers/management/remotemgmt.html)** directly from the System Center Operations Manager console using HP iLO Advanced. 
  * **[Safely cap power usage to fit more](http://h18013.www1.hp.com/products/servers/management/dynamic-power-capping/index.html)** servers within existing power envelopes &ndash; up to triple the capacity &ndash; without putting electrical infrastructure at risk with HP Dynamic Power Capping.
