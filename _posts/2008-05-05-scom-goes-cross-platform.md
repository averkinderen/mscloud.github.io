Last week Microsoft announced that scom is going cross platform!

This is a HUGE thing! Beside the Microsoft environment, many of my clients have also some Unix or Linux machines. For the linux machines they ussually use Nagios&#8230;

But now you can manage your whole datacenter from one single console with SCOM!

&nbsp;

The connectors are in betas now and you can download them from <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">the connect site</a>.
