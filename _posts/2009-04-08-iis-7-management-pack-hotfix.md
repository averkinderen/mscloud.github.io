As mentioned on the MOM team blog there was a <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/momteam/archive/2009/02/25/problem-with-the-iis-modules-qfe-957123.aspx" target="_blank">problem with the IIS 7 Managemenent pack</a>. After importing the Windows Server 2008 Internet Information Services 7.0 management pack, the Health Service will log error 4507. The issue is in the setup code which causes the SDK and Configuration services on the RMS to be stopped and disabled.

Today they released a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=f82ef6b3-a08e-4295-b9e3-fb78a74aefa8&displaylang=en" target="_blank">hotfix that you can find here</a>.
