Last year I wrote about the <a href="http://www.mscloud.be/oms-calculator/" target="_blank">OMS calculator </a>that was just released. Now that the OMS licenses has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/operations-management-suite-pricing" target="_blank">changed</a>, Microsoft updated the calculator and released a new version of it: <a href="http://aka.ms/omscalculator" target="_blank">http://aka.ms/omscalculator</a> . It&#8217;s really easy to use, you just need to fill in the number of nodes (or computers) and select which OMS components you would like to use.

A node can be a virtual machine, a physical server, a network device or other instance. You can buy additional nodes either upfront through a suite or by purchasing a pay-as-you-go plan. Node charges are calculated hourly and any nodes that report for only part of the month will be charged only for the timeframe they send data. A server that reports for 10 days in a month will be charged approximately 1/3rd of the price of the full month (based on 31 days).

You can find more information about the new OMS licensing here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/operations-management-suite-pricing.

Microsoft has divided OMS in 4 components:

I&#8217;m not going into detail in this blogpost on how it the OMS licensing works, as it&#8217;s pretty complicated.

Thanks,
