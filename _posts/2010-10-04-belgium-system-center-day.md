Scug.be is very excited to annouce our next event. For this occasion we have some top international speakers like Wally Mead, Travis Wright, Jason Buffington, 4 Belgium System Center MVP&#8217;s and other System Center Experts and that&#8217;s why the event will also be held in a special place <http://events.livingtomorrow.be/>

This event will also be your opportunity to socialize with fellow System Center administrators and consultants and exchange knowledge, meet with one of the most popular Microsoft speakers of all time and have a nice lunch with the 4 Belgian System Center MVP&#8217;s and the System Center product managers!
